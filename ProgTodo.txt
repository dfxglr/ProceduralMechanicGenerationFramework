Generative Part:
    Translate genome -> implementations of classes

    SVLC

    Multi-layer genome -> 2 separate genomes?
        How would that work with variable length?

    Repair functions:
        Fix empty actors/methods/etc

        

    CCE:
        overriding fitness func in lib:
            fit():
                get best + individual -> set
                get rand + individual -> set

                fitness_pmg(sets)

                is fitness better than previous best from species? (save/no)

                return best_fitness

        override population to handle multiple species?


handling constants?



convert all castings using is/as, also add exception handling to any place that does casting
